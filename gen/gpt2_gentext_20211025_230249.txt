A chinese martial artist's strength is somewhat of a mystery, but not everyone can tell the details of it.

However, one was able to learn to read those two words.

"Niu-chan, you know that I'm doing my best. I'll be using my breath to even out your voice. Now then, let's start to train our body."

The young man smiled and said bluntly.

"In order to see your heart, you need to breathe in a certain order."

The young man took out his longsword and pointed it towards the young woman's chest.

At the same time, the young woman's gaze flashed through the young man's body.
"In order to see your heart, you need to hold your breath for a certain amount of time. As for your body, you need to breathe by swallowing. I have not provided you with any special training. Please respect me for that."

"Your body, is it safe?"
The young woman hesitated.
The young man, was not only able to see his heart's temperature, but also his heart's rhythm.
"In order to see your heart, I have to breathe by swallowing. I have not provided you with any special training. Please respect me for that."
"That's not it! You're too selfish. You want to learn to read your heart. It's not like I'll just say that you can't read your heart, so I'm not going to let you try. I'm going to let you listen to me. You can still try."

The young woman raised her head.
"That's not it! I'm not going to let you try. I'm not going to let you try. I'm going to let you listen to me."
The young man sighed.
"That's not it! I'm not going to let you try. I'm not going to let you try. I'm going to let you listen to me."
